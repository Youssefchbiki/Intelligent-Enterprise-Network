## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents the **design and deployment of a secure enterprise IT network infrastructure** for a mid-sized organization.  
It integrates **VLAN segmentation, centralized server management, VPN access, and real-time monitoring**, ensuring a **robust, scalable, and secure digital environment** aligned with modern IT standards.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Design a **structured and segmented LAN** by department (HR, Finance, IT, Guest Wi-Fi)
- Deploy essential **core services**: Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, VPN
- Implement **security layers**: Firewall, Access Control Lists (ACLs), VPN encryption
- Integrate **intelligent monitoring** tools for proactive maintenance
- Deliver complete **network documentation and configuration files**

## 🔐 Security Best Practices
- VLAN isolation between departments  
- Strong password and user policy enforcement  
- Regular updates and patch management  
- VPN-only remote access  
- Log analysis and intrusion alerts via Zabbix  

---

## 🧩 Implementation Steps
1. Define requirements and business constraints  
2. Create logical and physical network topologies  
3. Configure routers, switches, and servers  
4. Deploy VLANs, DHCP, DNS, and VPN  
5. Implement firewall rules and access controls  
6. Configure monitoring (Zabbix, Syslog)  
7. Test, document, and deliver the final infrastructure  

---

## 📊 Results & Impact
- **Reliable and secure connectivity** across all departments  
- **Centralized IT management** reducing administrative workload  
- **Enhanced data protection** through layered security  
- **Scalable architecture** ready for future expansion
